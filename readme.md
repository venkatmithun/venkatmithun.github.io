#What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?
The most challenging piece of this assignment is working without javascript and designing the web application. I would find it less time consuming if I could've reused some code components. Without detailed wireframes it was indeed challenging to make design decisions on the fly and implement them. I spent around 8-9 hours in total but havent much worked on content and CSS yet.

#What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
I have used media queries for some content and while writing code I made sure there are no overlapping issues even though I haven't reduced the text.

#What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
Considering all the core features and amount of content I had in mind, I created simple straightforward design for now. Nothing I am proud of but I am planning on working on it and improve the design as I have already made sure code can be reused and split into components when there are any major design changes.

#Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
I would add proper navigation, improve code quality, add some transformations, work on content and CSS.

#How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I have spent around 10 hours on this assignment.
